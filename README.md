# pretend-src

this is an updated version(s) of pretend discord robot (super dog shit)

So basically heres the story from start to finish.

Pretend was ran by Sent who was a romanian skid (past) hes alright now, but I downed his bot for like 3 weeks as it was skidded and then, a group named Vypr Group Bought the bot from him.

Vypr was ran by Nick (CEO) Adam (COO) and a few others, who all left in the end.

Nick and Adam had a falling out because adam was a pathological liar and adam took the bot account for himself, while having 0 knowledge on python or how it worked.

After that Nick restarted the bot on a new bot account and it was going good, with adonis and trey (glory) doing work on it, until a feature idea that someone had was abused which was for preventing alts, and it ended up leaking someones IP by accident, after that nick decided to decomission the project and call it wraps.

Note that trey did none of the code updated in this source code, and adonis did very few if any, nick obviously didn't do any as he doesn't do python. The changes they made are not going to be included as tbh, it doesn't even matter, this bot is horrible and the ownership aside from nick was even worse.

Adam's current running version is a very miniscule alteration of this, just worse. For instance just last week his alteration posted dick pics in a bunch of channels due to his "new autopfp bucket".

There was an Images folder in here with like sub folders of images but it was so aids that i'm not downloading that onto my local machine.

Under no circumstance is this mean't to cause hate towards Adonis, Trey, or Nick.

# Notes

After this Post adam claimed that it was "recoded" yet it had the exact same response time to commands as the old source did, and the exact same issues as the old source did. nothing was altered in the time frame of this other than when I posted it, I deleted the PretendImages folder which had a shit load of images that github wouldn't allow to be uploaded as it would have made the source code to big in filesize to be posted.

All of the screenshots to backup the fact that he is infact a pathological liar, the only british developer he knows that can write python is Sam and Sam has not done anything with pretend, other then made them that website that they are using as a temporary website.
